Create you quizzes in Google Docs spreadsheets. 

Use a public (read-only) spreadsheet so that YQL can access it.

Create separate sheets for each quiz. You can also use a sheet to list and link to available quizzes.

YQL is used to query and parse the Google docs spreadsheet to JSON that can be used by jQwiz.
